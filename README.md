# Currency Converter by Maciej Lenartowicz

## Overview

This is a web-based currency converter that allows users to quickly and easily convert between three currencies. It was created as a homework project for a frontend developer course **YouCode**, but could be used as a template or starting point for more complex currency conversion applications. This project is created in the Polish language.
